Demo for AR confection sizes.
Basically its changed demo [https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/image_segmentation/android] for image segmentation where mask is used for measurement.
future improvements:
* use edge detection algorithm to catch body more precisely, used OpenCV grabCut and Canny (this is partially done in main trunk)
* measure more confection sizes,
* maybe send data to BE for further use cases???
